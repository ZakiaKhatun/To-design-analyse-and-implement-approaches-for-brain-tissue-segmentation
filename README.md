# To-design-analyse-and-implement-approaches-for-brain-tissue-segmentation
## This project aims to develop brain tissue (Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), White Matter (WM), and Gray Matter (GM)) segmentation method.

**Dataset**: 
Dataset used for this study is IBSR18 dataset which includes skull-stripped T1-w images and contains cases with different spatial resolutions (pixel spacing). Moreover, there is also a heterogeneity in image intensities which hinders segmentation.

Note: This project was a part of the 'Medical Image Segmentation and Applications' course (Master's third semester)
